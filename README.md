# README
Code repository used for AIAA's article "Imitation Learning of MPC for Fault Tolerant Control Allocation of an Octorotor"
### The codes are currently messy in terms of readability and organization. We are soon going to clean, refactor and organize it, as well as write an explanatory README. Feel free to send an e-mail asking for any clarifications at matheusribeiro10@gmail.com. We appreciate your understanding!
